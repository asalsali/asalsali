## ✨ About Me

I'm a product-minded builder with a background in software engineering, sports performance, and startup strategy.  
My journey has taken me from analyzing game film for Team Canada 🏀 to creating tools that improve diagnostic equity in healthcare 🏥.

Every project I touch is guided by the same principle: serve others well and build with intention.
